## Summary
The Acquia Commerce Manager Drupal module enables site builders to use tools
and templates in Drupal to rapidly build commerce experiences. It connects
Drupal sites to Acquia's Commerce Connector Service leveraging eCommerce 
systems as the source of truth for eCommerce data in these experiences.

## Installation
Module can be installed using Composer:
